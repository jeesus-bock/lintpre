# lintpre

A simple package to lint typescript files with eslint and format all sorts of source files with prettier.

I haven't put much time to this yet, but it's a start.

I'm testing out, on a really low-endd computer, different types of coding setups and not all the text editors have builtin language support,

So I figured out I'd put together something local that I can run from the cli regardlesss of the editor.

I bet vi(m) and emaacs have this stuff figured out but I am not that hardcore. Gotta point and click occcasionally
to keep the mouse hand warm :).
